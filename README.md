## Description

This is a recipe finder website, intended to help people make use of the ingredients in their fridge to cook meals they may not have thought of. 

## Installation

## Usage

Type in one or more ingredients (if more than one, use a comma to separate) that you would like to use for a meal and click the search button. Three recipes will populate the page, giving you information on the type of meal or drink, a photo of the meal, and the ingredients and measurements required to make it. Clicking the title will take you to the page or blog where the full recipe can be found. Your search history will be displayed, along with the date searched, under the search bar but can be cleared by clicking the red 'clear history' button. Clicking on an old search will repopulate the page with recipes that make use of that ingredient.
